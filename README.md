# liberate-winkelbottom-project

Maze game/project using collision detection and a keydown listener to navigate an irate garden gnome (Winkelbottom)
to his escape from his oppresive owners.

Winkel can only escape with the key and two toadstools. 

Possibly you could create a random maze which regenerates in a different layout each time. 

I will be using JS, CSS, and HTML.
